Hello! Welcome to the planet of WaTor! We have four types of creatures here:

Fish: 
    A basic creature, the fish feeds off the plantlife of 
    this planet and live peacefully.
Rabbit Fish: 
    Much like the fish, except it breeds startlingly fast.
Shark: 
    A ravenous creature, the shark will eat any fish it 
    finds. If it doesn't eat in too long, it dies.
Dolphin: 
    We're not sure where these creatues come from. They eat 
    fish like a shark, but also eat plants, thus do not starve.
    The most peculiar part is they seem content with the numbers 
    they have. They appear quite smart... I wonder if they know 
    something we dont...

And that's it! I've heard there's some aliens that were 
scouting this planet for some reason, but I'm sure that's 
nothing to worry about.
